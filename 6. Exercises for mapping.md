# ASSIGNMENT FOR MAPPING

## Generate the GRCh38 positions and HGVS protein IDs for variants in the [file](http://structure.bmc.lu.se/VariBench/EXTENSION/VariationTypeDatasets/SubstitutionsCodingRegion/TrainingDatasets/Dataset20/SC_TD_D20_F1_training_dataset1.csv)

1. tsv to vcf
2. use VEP (GRCh37) for VEP analysis to output HGVS protein IDs
    As we found most of the annotations, we suppose the input data are GRCh37
3. liftover to GRCh38
    As the liftover python api is quite slow, here I wrote a bed file and used the ucsc web tool (this is super quick)
4. merge the fields GRCh38 positions and HGVS protein IDs to the input dataset
