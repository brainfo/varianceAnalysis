# Exercises for Systematics

## HGNC and VGNC

### Find alias names and symbols.
*NLM1* is a gene symbol whoes gene model is [At4g19030.1](https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=gene&name=At4g19030.1). It is annotated in the Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) and encoding [A0A1P8B5K6 Â· A0A1P8B5K6_ARATH](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A1P8B5K6/entry) (NOD26-like major intrinsic protein 1).

Therefore, I would analyze *ADA* in the following assignments.

alias names and symbols for gene *ADA*:

- [*ADA1*][1][2]

[2]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/100

### Is there a mouse homologue?

Yes: [*Ada*](https://informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:87916)

## MANE

### Find MANE transcript for your gene.

Search term on NIH nucleotide: `(ADA[Gene Name] AND srcdb_refseq[PROP] AND MANE Select[Keyword] AND Homo sapiens[Organism])` and on ensembl.
Or just copy from HGNC entry:

- NM_000022.4
- ENST00000372874.9

## RefSeq

### How many transcripts are there and how do they differ?

There are four transcript variants. They are different in their sequence span on a genome assembly.

## UniProt

### How many variants are there in SwissProt and of which types?
Download variants report json file from UniProt and:
